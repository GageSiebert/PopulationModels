Linear2: 
Produces oscillations with approximately fixed frequency and with semi-linear declinations.
Performs a series of calculations, 'tics', per generation, but has too large a dependance on the 2-2-3
day oscillations of incubation period.

NoTics:
Produces oscillations with approximately fixed frequency and with semi-linear declinations.
Does only one calculation per generation.
